Adds userspace support for at least my DLC300 camera, with VID:PID of 1578:0076 under linux.

Might be useful to get the following cameras working as well: DLC130/130L, DLC131/131L, DLC200, DLC300, Whitehawk, Goldenhawk, and GoldenEagle. (only DLC300 tested)

Some notes about the reverse engineering process will soon (before august 16'th 2012) find its way to http://www.simong.eu/projects/dlc300
